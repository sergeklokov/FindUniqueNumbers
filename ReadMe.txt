Write a method that finds, efficiently with respect to time used, all numbers that occur exactly once in the input collection.
For example, FindUniqueNumbers(new int[]{1,2,1,3}) should return {2,3}.

This was a coding test from testdome.com for position at the company Prizelogic. 
I think they gave 20 min for it, which is more than enough for senior/midlevel programmer.

So.. I think they want the quickest algorithm. 
I would prefer the most quick-to-write algorithm, because I came from the "Quick-And-Dirty" startup culture.
But ok there are few solutions here.
Also I decided to get duplicates, we may need it too.

Anyway.. enjoy!
